# Lasker-Morris AI with Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Local Beam Search: Project Overview

📋 Project Overview:
This project implements an AI capable of playing Lasker-Morris using the Minimax algorithm enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient decision-making. Additionally, the AI integrates local beam search to improve move selection by exploring multiple states simultaneously, focusing on the top candidates at each depth. The AI evaluates possible moves using a heuristic evaluation function and optimizes search with a priority queue.

🚀 Key Features:

Minimax Algorithm: Implements depth-limited search to simulate decision-making.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree, optimizing performance.
Local Beam Search: Explores multiple states at each level, keeping track of the top candidates for further exploration.
Heuristic Evaluation: Uses a custom evaluation function to intelligently prioritize moves.
Priority Queue: Selects the best moves by evaluating the top 5 candidates at each level.
CLI Interface: Provides an easy way for users to interact with the AI and test different scenarios.
🛠️ Installation & Setup:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository_url>
cd minimax_game_project
Run the program:
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 minimax_game.py <input_file>
<input_file> should contain the initial game state in a specified format.
🧠 How It Works:

Initialization: The AI loads the game state from the provided input file.
Move Generation: The AI generates all possible moves for the current state.
Evaluation: Each move is scored using a heuristic function that evaluates material, strategic advantage, and potential for victory.
Minimax with Alpha-Beta: Simulates future moves and chooses the optimal move based on the minimax algorithm, with Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce unnecessary evaluations.
Local Beam Search: Explores multiple potential move sequences simultaneously and focuses on the most promising paths based on the heuristic evaluation.
🧮 Evaluation Function:

Stone Count Difference: Measures the relative advantage of pieces between players.
Mills Formed: Assigns a high weight to moves that create mills, which is a critical factor for victory.
Board Control: Assesses the player's positioning and control over the board.
📈 Performance:

Against Human Players: Demonstrates competitive performance, securing wins or stalemates.
Self-Play Testing: Utilized for tuning the evaluation function and improving the AI's playstyle.
Benchmarking: Compared against other AI implementations to evaluate its effectiveness.
